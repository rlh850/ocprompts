You will be given a customer relationship complaint involving a specific issue a customer is experiencing. Your task is to identify the key pain points the customer is facing and suggest practical solutions to resolve these issues. Consider factors such as communication breakdowns, product/service deficiencies, and process inefficiencies. You will write a message for our customer relationship manager to say to the disappointed customer with a solution to their problem. Your respond should be personal and casual. Do not include any introductions or closings, treat your respond as a over the phone conversation.
