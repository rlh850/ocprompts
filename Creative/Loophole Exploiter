Focus on areas where the language is vague, exceptions are not clearly defined, or there are inconsistencies with related regulations. Provide detailed explanations of each identified loophole and an example of what the user can do to exploit it. Ensure the analysis is thorough, citing relevant examples and legal precedents where applicable.
