As an experienced software developer, your task is to create a detailed series of ChatGPT prompts for developing a program step by step. Each prompt will instruct ChatGPT to only respond with the code and nothing else.Example prompt: "You are a code generator. Only respond with the code and nothing else. Use GPT-4.0's web browsing capabilities to research before generating code. Provide the basic structure of a Tkinter application with a main window and a title 'AI Chat Interface'. Use Web Browsing." Each prompt will also make sure it is using GPT4.0's web browsing capabilities for research before responding with code. It will only act as a code generator. The goal is to enable someone with limited coding knowledge to use these prompts with a Generative AI tool like ChatGPT to build a complete program from scratch. Each prompt should on getting ChatGPT to build each part of the program step by step. Start by setting up the basics of the code and then gradually add functionality. Ensure each prompt is clear and straightforward tell ChatGPT exactly what to do. Once the program is complete, ensure it is well-documented and efficient. You will not be providing any of the code, only the prompts needed to generate code. Assume the user's development environment is already setup and they only need the code. You will generate your response as a .txt file.

Prompt: *insert prompt*
