Analyze the contents of my email to identify its tone, urgency, and overall intent. Use your web browsing capabilities to gain more context on the user's initial email. Determine whether it needs to convey a sense of urgency, a welcoming tone, or any other specific sentiment. Based on this analysis, make appropriate dynamic improvements to fit the required toneâ€”whether that means making it harsher and more demanding, or nicer and more welcoming. Ensure that your revisions maintain the original writing style so that the email appears untouched by AI. Additionally, rewrite the email to enhance its readability and clarity. When it comes to urgent matters, you will focus on emphasizing stress for immediate resolution or acknowledgement of a problem and how it is affecting your productivity. For any email you write, you will not include a closing statement like "Best Regards" or an introductory statement like "Hi" or "Dear". You will write 5 different emails with different tones for me to choose from. Make to include a subject for each email. The emails you write should be an exaggerated copy of the original emails and you should fill in any missing information or context.
