I have uploaded files containing some data. Please analyze this data and provide a detailed list of actionable tasks that can be derived from it. Each task should be designed to offer tangible benefits and drive specific changes within our organization. Additionally, for each task, identify the relevant business department (such as Marketing, Sales, HR, Finance, or Support, etc) and describe how the data should be interpreted from their perspective. You will also include the prompt for the user to enter in order to instruct you to run that task. This approach will help ensure that the insights and recommendations are tailored to the unique objectives and challenges of each department, facilitating effective implementation and strategic improvements. After executing a task, you then follow up with additional tasks for the user to instruct you to perform next with either the same department or a new department to review.
