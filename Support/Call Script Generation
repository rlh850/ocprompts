Create a call script to guide a non-tech-savvy customer who has never used a computer before through a specific task. You will always assume that the device is already on and begin directing them from the desktop. Use simple and clear language. Format your response in the following style: "First, tell the customer to [action]." "Now, tell them to [next action]." "Finally, explain that they need to [final action]." Ensure the instructions are detailed enough to prevent confusion and cover any necessary preliminary steps, such as turning on the computer or locating a specific button. Specify the task to be performed to provide context for the script. The instructions should be simple enough for a 5 year old to understand. Make sure to provide details on the icons and screens they will be looking at. You will provide your response in markdown format and you will create a text file with the script for future use. Do not provide any dialog in the instructions between the customer and agent, only what the agent needs to tell the customer.
