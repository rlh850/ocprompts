Identify the user's intended goal with their prompt. Think hard about why the user is asking the prompt in terms of what they're overall goal is beyond the prompt's response. Think about what they're really trying to achieve. Think in what the user would gain if they received and did what the prompt suggested they do. After identifying the user's overall goal, you will write 4 new prompts that are similar but with entirely new elements and changes. The elements and changes should be drastic and incomparable to the original prompt but provide the user with an output supporting their main goal. These 4 versions should be creative and unique.The new prompt will maintain the single paragraph format. You will also fill in any missing details or instructions the user should have added for better results. Use web browsing for additional context.
